# Introduction to Cozy

Let's make a game!


## Getting Started

First, you'll want to download Cozy. You can grab it from the Cozy website.

> https://cozyengine.com/

Install it! Then run it.


## The Project Manager

When you run Cozy, you will be presented with the Project Manager. If this is the first time you've started it, you should see a small list of example games.

### Games

A Cozy game is defined by a folder or directory that contains a `config.json` file. For any game listed in your Project Manager, you can click it, and get a pop up with some information about the game. From there you can play the game, as well as a handful of other things.

### Game Libraries

A game library is just a directory that contains one or more games. If you put a new game in a library directory you've already created, Cozy should pick it up and show it (you can click the refresh button on that library to force it to reload if it's not showing up).

Clicking the + button on a game library will set up a new, empty game under that directory.

### Toolbar

There are a handful of important buttons on the toolbar at the top of the screen.

- Add Game Library (+): Lets you add a new folder of games to the list of libraries. If you wish to make a new space for your projects, or for other games that you've gotten from other Cozy users, use this. You just need to add the parent folder of all your games, not each game individually.
- Mute sounds/music (speaker icon, music note icons): These act as global toggles for sound and music, respectively, when you play a game. If you are working on a game and want to temporarily mute it without changing the settings of the game (and potentially shipping a muted game by accident), use these.
- Settings (gear icon): Settings for the project manager. Right now, this is just a list of kit libraries (see below). Like game libraries, you don't have add the each kit's library individually, you can just add a parent directory and every kit underneath it will be available to your games. 


## Running a Game

When you start a game, a new window will open. A small loading animation will play until the game is ready to fully launch, and then game play should take over. While the game is open, press the ` or ~ key to open the developer console.
